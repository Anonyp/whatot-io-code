<p>Over the past couple years I have seen many threads asking about project ideas. I have seen a few answers, and given a few answers, that listed a couple common projects. I never felt it was a good enough job to just list 2 or 3 topics. So I have set forth on a mission to compile a list of projects (common and not) for all you programmers out there in search of a simple learning project. No these are not going to be thesis level projects and are meant to only spark ideas and for ways to expand from these ideas.</p>
<p>在过去的几年内我看到不少帖子问自已应该做什么项目。我看到了不少回答，也做了不少，因而积累了一些常见的，你们可以做的小项目。我认为只列两三个主意没什么意思，于是我开始寻找那些常见的、程序员应该学去做的东西。哦，这些不是给你写论文用的，它只是一些沉淀下来的思维火花。</p>
<p>Below you will find 125 project ideas I have come up with while brainstorming. I have divided them into 10 different topic areas that I think the project may use the most. Keep in mind that a few of these projects could have been classified in more than one topic.</p>
<p>在下面你将看到 100 个项目思路。它们是我从头脑风暴里提取出来的。我把它们分成 9 个分类，方便诸位挑选习作。</p>
